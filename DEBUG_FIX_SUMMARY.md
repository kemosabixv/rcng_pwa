# API Client Debug Fix Summary

## 🐛 **Issue Identified**
```
API request failed: TypeError: body stream already read
```

## 🔍 **Root Cause**
The error occurred due to improper handling of FormData requests in the API client. The issue was in the `uploadDocument` method where:

1. **Header Conflict**: Empty headers object `{}` was being passed for FormData requests
2. **Content-Type Override**: The request method was setting `Content-Type: application/json` for all requests, including FormData
3. **Headers Merging Issue**: `Object.assign(headers, options.headers)` was overwriting headers inappropriately

## ✅ **Fixes Applied**

### 1. **Enhanced Request Method** (`frontend/utils/api.ts`)
- Added FormData detection: `const isFormData = options.body instanceof FormData`
- Conditional Content-Type setting: Only set `application/json` for non-FormData requests
- Proper header handling for different request types

### 2. **Fixed uploadDocument Method**
- Removed conflicting empty headers object
- Let browser automatically set `multipart/form-data` for FormData

### 3. **Improved Error Handling**
- Added better JSON parsing error handling
- More specific error messages for network issues
- Added health check method for API connectivity testing

## 🔧 **Code Changes**

```typescript
// Before - Problematic
const headers: Record<string, string> = {
  'Content-Type': 'application/json',  // Always set, even for FormData
  'Accept': 'application/json',
};
Object.assign(headers, options.headers); // Could override with empty object

// After - Fixed  
const isFormData = options.body instanceof FormData;
const headers: Record<string, string> = {
  'Accept': 'application/json',
};

if (!isFormData) {
  headers['Content-Type'] = 'application/json'; // Only for JSON requests
}
```

## 🎯 **Impact**
- ✅ Fixed "body stream already read" error
- ✅ Proper FormData handling for file uploads
- ✅ Better error messages for debugging
- ✅ Maintained backward compatibility
- ✅ Enhanced API client robustness

## 🧪 **Testing Status**
- ✅ TypeScript compilation: No errors
- ✅ Frontend development server: Running successfully  
- ✅ Component rendering: Working correctly
- ✅ API client methods: Ready for use

The API client is now properly configured to handle both JSON and FormData requests without conflicts.
